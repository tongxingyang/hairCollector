Json.<i></i>NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET and the
most used framework throughout the whole .NET ecosystem.

This repo is a **fork** of [JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json][newtonsoft.json.git]
containing custom builds for regular standalone, but more importantly AOT
targets such as all **IL2CPP builds (WebGL, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac OS X)**
and portable .NET **(UWP, WP8)**.

## Features

- Expected always up-to-date fork of Newtonsoft.Json

- Full Newtonsoft.Json.Tests test suite passes on Unity 2018.4.14f1 and
  2019.2.11f1 with Mono and IL2CPP as scripting backend.

- Precompiled as DLLs for faster builds

- Full support for IL2CPP builds

- Delivered via Unity Package Manager for easy updating and version switching

- [_Newtonsoft.Json.Utility_.**AotHelper**][wiki-fix-aot-using-aothelper]
  utility class for resolving common Ahead-Of-Time issues.
  [(Read more about AOT)][wiki-what-even-is-aot]

- Extensive [documentation of solving AOT issues with `link.xml`][wiki-fix-aot-using-link.xml]

- `(üåü new!)` Optional side package [Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity.Converters][json.net-4-unity.converters]
  to help with converting Unity types, such as the Vector3, Quaternion, Color,
  and [many, many more!][json.net-4-unity.converters-compatability]

## Contributing

Thankful that you're even reading this :)

If you want to contribute, here's what you can do:

- **Spread the word!** ‚ù§ More users &rarr; more feedback &rarr; I get more
  will-power to work on this project. This is the best way to contribute!

- [Open an issue][issue-create]. Could be a feature request for a new converter,
  or maybe you've found a bug?

- [Tackle one of the unassigned issues][issue-list-unassigned]. If it looks like
  a fun task to solve and no one is assigned, then just comment on it and say
  that you would like to try it out.

  I realize that few of the issues are trivial, so if you wish to tackle
  something small then look at the list of unassigned issues over at the
  [Unity converters package][json.net-4-unity.converters] repoistory.

- Open a PR with some new feature or issue solved. Remember to ask before
  starting to work on anything, so no two are working on the same thing.

  Having a feature request or issue pop up and having the submitter suggesting
  themselves to later add a PR for a solution is the absolute greatest gift
  a repository maintainer could ever receive. üéÅ

  I have this [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file that contains some
  guidelines. It may be good to read it beforehand.

## Development

### Edit code

Open the `Src/Newtonsoft.Json.sln` solution file in Visual Studio and start
hacking.

Rule of thumb: Don't commit edits of the `Src/Newtonsoft.Json/`,
`Src/Newtonsoft.Json.Tests/`, or `Src/Newtonsoft.Json.TestConsole/` folders
for forking reasons. Exception is when doing a new release, as explained in
a section little further down below.

### Build

When using Visual Studio, open the `Src/Newtonsoft.Json.sln` solution and just
<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd> üòú

When using command line, recommended to use MSBuild.exe for building and not the
dotnet CLI.

```powershell
PS> MSBuild.exe -t:build -restore .\Src\Newtonsoft.Json -p:Configuration=Debug
```

### Run tests

Run the Newtonsoft.Json.Tests normally via the Test Runner inside Visual Studio.

For testing inside Unity locally, look inside the
[Src/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity.Tests/README.md](/Src/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity.Tests/README.md)
for more information.

### Merging changes from JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json

Common enough occurrence that we have a wiki page for just this.

Read the [Working with branches, section "Merging changes from JamesNKs
repo"][wiki-workingwithbranches#merging] wiki page.

## Shameless plug

This project, giving a stable Newtonsoft.Json experience to the Unity community,
is a hobby project for me and will always stay free.

If this tool gave you something you value, consider giving a coin back into this
tool. Sponsor me with a cup of coffee, I drink the cheap stuff! ‚òï
